An Interstellar Journey is a game that allows the player to pilot a spacecraft and travel through space with Earth as the starting point and the exoplanet HD 80653 b as the final destination. Along the way, the player will encounter some difficulties that must be overcome to reach the destination. The goal is to interest people in breakthrough spacecraft propulsion, using current and theoretical technology, making the relationship with science and science fiction. We also want to get people interested in STEAM in a fun and easy way.
